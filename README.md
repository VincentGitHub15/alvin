# Medical Map

## locates medical facilities for procedures

### This is a proof of concept mockup created for Alvin Healthcare.

Check it out at medicalmap.us

This mockup was created with dummy data as public medical pricing is hard to find. The backend database (PostgreSQL) is ready to scale and could easily handle incoming information.

Begin typing into the search bar, you will see the current procedures in the database that match.

The current focus of the map is in NYC, and will automatically center there by default. If you allow the app to use your IP address for location, you will probably not see any facilities locally until more data is added.

The prices for the procedures in our database are completely made up and are meant only as placeholders. They are not accurate estimates.

The facilities that are in the database do exist and their addresses are correct as of May 2017.

The current procedures and their CPT code are accurate.
